# ML Playground

This repository contains a collection of notebooks and scripts that I'm using to learn and experiment with machine learning.

My TODO list:

- [x] Implement a NN from scratch in Numpy
- [x] Do backpropagation by hand for a simple NN
- [x] Try PyTorch
- [x] Try Keras
- [ ] Try TensorFlow
- [ ] Try JAX
- [ ] Try Scikit-learn
- [x] Classify MNIST digits
- [ ] Classify CIFAR-10 images
- [ ] Classify ImageNet images
- [x] Sentiment analysis on IMDB reviews
- [x] Try CNN
- [ ] Try RNN
- [ ] Try GAN
- [ ] Try KAN
- [ ] Try LSTM
- [ ] Try Reinforcement Learning
- [x] Try Transformers
- [ ] Train a GPT model
- [ ] Train a multi-modal model
